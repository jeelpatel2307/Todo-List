### Todo List in Java

This project implements a simple console-based Todo List application in Java. The application allows users to add tasks, remove tasks by index, and display all tasks in the list.

### Features:

- **Add Task:** Users can add tasks to the Todo List.
- **Remove Task:** Users can remove tasks by specifying the index of the task.
- **Display Tasks:** Users can view all tasks currently in the Todo List.

### How to Use:

1. **Compile the Code:** Compile the Java file using any Java compiler.
    
    ```bash
    javac TodoList.java
    
    ```
    
2. **Run the Application:** Execute the compiled class file.
    
    ```bash
    java TodoList
    
    ```
    
3. **Interact with the Todo List:** Follow the on-screen menu prompts to add, remove, and display tasks in the Todo List.

### Note:

- This implementation is console-based and does not include any graphical user interface (GUI).
- Tasks are stored in memory and will be lost once the program exits.
